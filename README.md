# General Information
This assignment was completed during Spring Quarter at UCSB, on May 28, 2025 for ENVS 193DS- Statistics for Environmental Science by Sanjana Sujeet.
These are the packages I used: 
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(here)
library(gt)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(magick)

# Data and File info
All data was collected by Sanjana Sujeet throughout the quarter and is located in the data folder. The data measures how many hours and pages I read each day and stress levels each day calculated from assignments, tests, and perceived stress. 

All code is in the code folder. This cleans and visualizes my personal data, has my sketch of an affective visualization example, and contains a critique of another paper: 
Rachel R. Leads a, et al. “Spatial and Temporal Variability of Microplastic Abundance in Estuarine Intertidal Sediments: Implications for Sampling Frequency.” Science of The Total Environment, Elsevier, 17 Nov. 2022, www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969722074083?via%3Dihub.
